# GRAD_1001114_A_SOROCABA_2025_1 - Introduction to Programming

This repository was created to store all files related to the **Introduction to Programming** course, offered in the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science program at UFSCar.

## About the Course

The main objectives of the course are:
- Introduce programming logic concepts;
- Present a programming language (focused on C) for algorithm development;
- Demonstrate data manipulation techniques;
- Cover control structures and file handling.

## Course Content

The main topics covered include:
1. Programming language concepts;
2. Algorithms;
3. Data types and expressions;
4. Structured and sequential programming;
5. Selection structures;
6. Repetition structures;
7. Procedures;
8. File handling.

## Methodology and Tools

**Tools Used:**
- Computer with Internet access;
- Virtual Learning Environment (VLE);
- Linux Operating System;
- C programming language;
- IDE for implementing exercises.

**Teaching Methodology:**
- In-person classes with roll call;
- Exercise lists provided after each class to reinforce concepts;
- Evaluation through two written exams (P1 and P2) and exercise lists, with the possibility of a Complementary Assessment (PAC) for students with an average between 5.0 and 6.0.

## Evaluation

The final grade (M) is calculated using the following formula:
- **M = 0.3 × P1 + 0.5 × P2 + 0.2 × (average of exercise lists)**

**Approval Criteria:**
- Minimum attendance of 75%;
- Completion of at least 5 exercise lists;
- Minimum final grade of 5.0 to pass.  
If the final average is between 5.0 and 6.0, the student is eligible for a Complementary Assessment (PAC).

*Note:* In cases of plagiarism or cheating, severe measures will be applied, potentially resulting in immediate failure (M = 0.0).
